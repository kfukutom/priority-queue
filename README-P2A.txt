This file includes two important parts: P2random (.h and .cpp)
for coding Part A, as well as some sample files.

We've included the spec test case with output.  It was run with verbose and
median modes turned on, and -s 10.

If you're running without the flags, just look for the VICTORY or DEFEAT line
in the sample output.  Everything before that line is either verbose or median,
everything after that line is statistics.
